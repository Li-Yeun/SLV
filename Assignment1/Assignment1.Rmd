## Libraries
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Load the data
In this section we load and pre-process the data. This means that we define which variables are factors and change their labels. We will also add some variables in order to make pretty plots.\\

Just for illustration: we can use Latex-language in markdown files:
\begin{align*}
  2x+ 1 & = 5\\
  2x & = 4\\
  x & = 2
\end{align*}
```{r, message = FALSE}
data <- 
  read_csv("data/spotify_top_charts_22.csv") %>% 
  select(-uri) %>% 
  mutate(key = recode(key, 
                      "0"="C","1"="C#","2"="D","3"="D#","4"="E","5"="F","6"="F#","7"="G","8"="G#","9"="A",
                      "10"="A#","11"="B") 
                      %>% as.factor()) %>% 
  mutate(mode = recode(mode, 
                      "0" = "minor", "1" = "major") 
                      %>% as.factor()) %>% 
  mutate(time_signature = recode(time_signature, 
                      "1" = "1/4", "3" = "3/4", "4" = "4/4", "5" = "5/4") 
                      %>% as.factor()) %>% 
  mutate(colab = case_when(grepl(",", artist_names) ~ "YES", !grepl(",", artist_names) ~ "NO") %>% as.factor())

```
